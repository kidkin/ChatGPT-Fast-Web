> [Project demo](https://107.151.246.180)
> You may enter your own key or try the server's built-in key. The server is relatively slow and it takes a few seconds to respond after input, which is not indicative of the response speed when deployed locally.

> Deploy your own personal ChatGPT web application locally, supporting GPT3 and GPT4 models.
> No backend server required, lightweight, and responsive.
